### Research Engineer in THz Spectroscopy and Imaging {date="Jul.~2021 \\ Aug.~2024"}

Developed
a THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)
data pipeline
with an improved signal-to-noise ratio
by utilizing sensitivity profile-shaped filtering.

Developed
a computationally cheap
THz-TDS data processing method
for refractive index and thickness extraction
in low-absorption materials.

Streamlined
refractive index profile reconstruction
from THz-TDS data
by offloading calculations
to a GPU
and utilizing backpropagation-based
optimization algorithms.

<!-- Implemented
a low-cost operation
and
high spectral quality
broadband THz-TDS setup
by suppressing atmospheric absorption
with silica gel-based dehumidification. -->

Automated laboratory workflows
by implementing Python tools
for measurement orchestration,
data management,
analysis,
and result presentation.

Ensured best software development practices
by implementing unit testing,
CI/CD pipelines,
and documentation.

<!-- Led
the SAPHIRE project,
developing
non-destructive
_in-situ_ solutions
to control
pill coating thickness
and humidity. -->

<!-- Led the development of
THz-TDS-based methods
for polymer wastes sorting. -->
